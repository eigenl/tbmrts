Text Based Multiplayer RTS
======

Here you can find the server and client-side code of [Text Based Multiplayer RTS][1], a little game I've been working on.

It's an RTS game similar to C&C. You build and upgrdade your base, train infantry and build vehicles to take on
up to 8 other players in a real-time strategy game.

Your tanks may be mighty but you are the key in combat - can you out-type your opponent?


This is a spiritual and technical successor to [Text Based Multiplayer Shooter][2] which was surprisingly popular. Since
then I've been wanting to make something similar, but with a little more depth.

This is my first NodeJS + WebSockets application and it probably shows. I'm looking for ways to improve so if NodeJS is your *thing* give it a look.
